\section{Piano Generation Noise Sine Transient}

\cite{sitranoPiano}

\subsection{Important bullet points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using "Sine, Transient, Noise" decomposition to design a differentiable spectral modeling synthesizer.
    \item Three sub-modules (independent trainable models) learn these components.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quasi-harmonic: Uses physics formulas to estimate quasi-harmonic parameters automatically.
        \item Noise: Uses a time-varying filter
        \item Transient: Deep convolutional network. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item More emulation of coupling between different notes with a convolutional-based network.
    \item General difficulty in accurately modeling the attack phase of notes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Harmonic-Percussive (HP) separation}
