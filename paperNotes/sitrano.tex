\subsubsection{Harmonic-Percussive (HP) separation}

Separates the sinusoidal component from the transient component.

A signal can be decomposed into its "transient", "sinusoidal" and "noise" components by analizing the lineality of its spectrogram. For example, a vertical line will be a 100\% transient event, while a perfectly horizontal line will be a 100\% sinusoidal event. Anything in-between can be catalogued as noise, within some (I'm not sure if arbitrarily) defined thresholds.

So initially for SiTraNo, the logic of <25\% horizontal lineality will be a transient, and >75\% horizontal lineality will be a sinusoid. The remaining 50\% will be considered noise.
